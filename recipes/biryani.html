    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Biryani is a highly aromatic and flavorful rice dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It is a one-pot dish made by layering fragrant basmati rice with marinated meat (such as chicken, mutton, or fish), or vegetables, and a rich blend of spices. The meat or vegetables are typically cooked separately with spices and yogurt to enhance the flavors. The rice is partially cooked separately and then layered with the cooked meat or vegetables in a pot. The layers are then sealed and slow-cooked, allowing the rice to absorb the flavors of the meat and spices, resulting in a delicious and aromatic dish. Biryani is often garnished with fried onions, nuts, and fresh herbs. It is a popular and beloved dish known for its diverse regional variations and is enjoyed on special occasions or as a hearty meal.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basmati rice</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong> (such as chicken, mutton, or fish) or vegetables</li>
        <li><strong>Spices</strong> (such as cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves)</li>
        <li><strong>Yogurt</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Onions</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, marinate the meat (or vegetables) with yogurt and a blend of spices, including cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. Allow it to marinate for at least 30 minutes to enhance the flavors.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pot over medium heat and add sliced onions. Saut√© the onions until they turn golden brown, adding a pinch of salt to help them caramelize evenly.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated meat (or vegetables) to the pot and cook until it is partially cooked and sealed. This helps in retaining moisture and flavor.</li>
        <li>Parboil the soaked rice in a separate pot until it is about 70-80% cooked. Drain the rice and layer it on top of the partially cooked meat (or vegetables) in the pot. You can alternate layers of rice and meat/vegetables for a layered biryani.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with aluminum foil to create a steamy environment. Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the rice to fully cook. This slow-cooking process helps in infusing the rice with the aromatic spices and tenderizing the meat or vegetables.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, let the biryani rest for a few minutes before gently fluffing the rice with a fork. Serve hot, garnished with fried onions, nuts, and fresh herbs.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Following these steps will result in a delicious biryani, packed with aromatic flavors. Enjoy your flavorful biryani!</p>
